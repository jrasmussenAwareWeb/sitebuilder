Navbar Search Box
Error :
"NetworkError: 404 Not Found - http://poc781.helpshow.me/Areas/AccelcorSiteBuilder/Content/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.woff2?v=4.6.3"

the alignment data option doesnt work because the styles / classes are applied to the li instead of the parent ul where it should go.

component properties tab cannot be selected once placed (doesnt show) - have to delete via content editor
